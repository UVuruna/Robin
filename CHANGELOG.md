## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure 🔴 **PRIORITY**
Must be completed first as everything depends on these:

#### `core/` folder
- [ ] `core/capture/region_manager.py` - Region coordinate management
- [ ] `core/ocr/tesseract_ocr.py` - Tesseract wrapper implementation
- [ ] `core/ocr/template_ocr.py` - Template matching OCR
- [ ] `core/input/action_queue.py` - Priority action queue
- [ ] `core/communication/shared_state.py` - Shared memory state

#### `data_layer/` folder  
- [ ] `data_layer/models/base.py` - Data models (Round, Threshold, Bet, RGB)
- [ ] `data_layer/models/round.py` - Round specific model
- [ ] `data_layer/models/threshold.py` - Threshold specific model
- [ ] `data_layer/database/connection.py` - Connection pool implementation
- [ ] `data_layer/database/query_builder.py` - SQL query builder

### Phase 2: Orchestration Layer 🟠
Depends on Core, needed before Collectors/Agents:

#### `orchestration/` folder
- [ ] `orchestration/coordinator.py` - Multi-worker synchronization
- [ ] `orchestration/health_monitor.py` - Process health monitoring
- [ ] `orchestration/bookmaker_worker.py` - Individual worker process

### Phase 3: Business Logic 🟡
Depends on Core + Orchestration:

#### `collectors/` folder
- [ ] `collectors/base_collector.py` - Abstract base collector
- [ ] `collectors/phase_collector.py` - Game phase collector

#### `strategies/` folder
- [ ] `strategies/martingale.py` - Martingale betting strategy
- [ ] `strategies/fibonacci.py` - Fibonacci betting strategy
- [ ] `strategies/custom_strategy.py` - Custom strategy templates

### Phase 4: Automation Agents 🟢
Depends on all above:

#### `agents/` folder
- [ ] `agents/session_keeper.py` - Session maintenance agent
- [ ] `agents/strategy_executor.py` - Strategy execution engine

### Phase 5: Future Enhancements 🔵
Optional improvements:

#### `data_layer/cache/` folder
- [ ] `data_layer/cache/redis_cache.py` - Redis caching layer

#### `core/ocr/` folder
- [ ] `core/ocr/cnn_ocr.py` - CNN-based OCR (ML model)
